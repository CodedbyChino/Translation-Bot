# Language Translation Bot

## Project Overview

The Language Translation Bot is a serverless application built on AWS that allows users to translate text from one language to another using Amazon Translate. The application utilizes Amazon S3 buckets to store input text files and translated text results, along with an AWS Lambda function to orchestrate the translation process.

## Benefits

The Language Translation Bot can be used for various purposes, including:

- Translating documents, emails, or messages into different languages.
- Enabling multi-lingual communication in chatbots or customer support systems.
- Facilitating language learning by translating text between native and target languages.

## Usage Guide

1. Upload a text file containing the text you want to translate to the source S3 bucket.
2. The Lambda function triggers automatically upon file upload and translates the text using Amazon Translate.
3. The translated text is then uploaded to the target S3 bucket.
4. Access the translated text from the target S3 bucket for further use or download.

## Instructions

To recreate the Language Translation Bot:

1. Set up an AWS account if you don't have one already.
2. Create two S3 buckets: one for input text files and another for translated text results.
3. Create an AWS Lambda function to handle file uploads, translate text using Amazon Translate, and upload the translated text to the target S3 bucket.
4. Configure event notifications on the source S3 bucket to trigger the Lambda function upon file upload.
5. Test the application by uploading text files to the source S3 bucket and verifying the translated text in the target S3 bucket.
